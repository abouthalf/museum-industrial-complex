Investing in Art is a risky business. To do it well you must spend time in upstart *commercial* galleries, in grimy artistsâ€™ studios, investing in artworks which are worth less than the materials they are made from. Instead throwing time and money at the problem, why not make a contribution to your local museum?

We are a network of museums, critics, and historians. We cultivate artists who make only the *right* sort of art. Art with moral and historical authority. Investing in art via the museum industrial complex ensures social relevance and historical value because *we write the history books* and *we tell the art viewing public what they should see.*

Don't leave your cultural authority to chance. Let the experts handle it.
